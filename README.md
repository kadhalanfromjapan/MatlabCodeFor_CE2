# MatlabCodeFor_CE2
# CE2 Lab Simulation Suite™ 💻📡

Welcome to the **officially unofficial** MATLAB repo for the *intellectually overqualified yet time-deficient* student.

## 🔥 Features

- Copy-paste ready code for every MATLAB lab experiment (because reinventing the wheel is for losers).
- Carefully curated outputs, because MATLAB's plots are prettier when pre-generated.
- Syntax that even MATLAB itself would salute.
- One script to rule them all. One line to fool them all.

## 💡 Purpose

This repository is designed for **"educational review"** purposes only. It allows one to:
- "Recall" code during moments of *stress-induced amnesia*.
- "Validate" your hands-on skills by comparing them with these absolutely coincidental solutions.
- "Debug" your conscience in real-time.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This code was not written during lab hours. Any resemblance to actual experiment questions is purely... uh, *theoretical*.

We do not condone academic dishonesty. This is simply a **backup plan** for students with *divine lab luck* and an *absolutely perfect moral compass*.

## 🧠 Pro Tip

Want to look extra smart? Rename the repo to something like `matlab_final_review_notes_v1` or `image_processing_utils` and smile confidently while pasting.
